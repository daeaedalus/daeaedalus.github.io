_Privacy_ is defined as the freedom to selectively express yourself: to have
privacy is to have a _choice_ about what bits of information you would like to
share and with whom. As late as the 1990s, whether your life was private or not
was a simple function of whether you chose to include your number in the phone
book.

The natural state of the Internet today is the opposite of this: hundreds of
unique corporate entities collect kilobytes of identifying information every
time you visit a site. Every step you take on this planet is recorded in a
database and sent to at least 75 unique companies.[^2]
