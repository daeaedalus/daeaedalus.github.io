They know everything about me. They can listen to me. They can watch me. They know what I like. They know what I don&#39;t like. They know <em>everything</em>. Privacy, as it has always been defined is over. It has been for a long time. There&#39;s no putting the genie back in the bottle.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fndef:1" class=fnref >[1]</a></sup></p> </blockquote> <p><em>Privacy</em> is defined as the freedom to selectively express yourself: to have privacy is to have a <em>choice</em> about what bits of information you would like to share and with whom. As late as the 1990s, whether your life was private or not was a simple function of whether you chose to include your number in the phone book.</p> <p>The natural state of the Internet today is the opposite of this: hundreds of unique corporate entities collect kilobytes of identifying information every time you visit a site. Every step you take on this planet is recorded in a database and sent to at least 75 unique companies.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fndef:2" class=fnref >[2]</a></sup></p> <p><table class=fndef  id="fndef:1"> <tr> <td class=fndef-backref ><a href="#fnref:1">[1]</a> <td class=fndef-content ><a href="https://soundcloud.com/user-98066669/212-vital-privacy-security-osint-updates">The Privacy, Security, &amp; OSINT Show, episode #212</a> </table> <table class=fndef  id="fndef:2"> <tr> <td class=fndef-backref ><a href="#fnref:2">[2]</a> <td class=fndef-content ><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/10/business/location-data-privacy-apps.html">Your Apps Know Where You Were Last Night, and They’re Not Keeping It Secret - The New York Times</a> </table> </p> <div class=page-foot > <div class=copyright > &copy; dæædalus.
